### General NodeJS

1. Download the repository to your machine or VPS.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Start the server: `npx deno task start`

## Develop

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mzl980425/uni-function.git
cd uni-function
```

### Start development server

```bash
deno task dev

# Or if you don't have the Deno environment, run:
npx deno task dev

# Then open in browser: http://localhost:8000/
```

## How It Works

uni-function uses a simple architecture:

1. A central handler function (`src/handler.ts`) processes all incoming requests
2. Platform-specific adapters in the `api/` directory connect this handler to different cloud platforms
3. Each adapter imports the common handler and exposes it in the format required by its platform
4. Build scripts in `deno.json` generate optimized deployments for each target platform

This approach allows you to write your function logic once in the handler, while the adapters take care of platform-specific requirements.
